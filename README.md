# EDA-of-Telecom-Churn-rate

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyse data. The first and foremost task that
the data analysts does is to view the data and tries to make some sense out of it. Later we figure
out what questions we want to ask and how to use the available data to get the answers we need.

EDA helps us to: 
1. Delve into the data set 
2. Examine the relationships among the variables
3. Identify any interesting observation 4) Develop an initial idea of possible associations among
the predictors and the target variable.

The telecom market in the US is saturated and customer growth rates are low. They key focus
of market players therefore is on retention and churn control. This project explores the churn
dataset to identify the key drivers of churn and grab key insights from the dataset.
